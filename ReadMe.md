# Welcome, Prospect Intern!

This repository contains the preset codebase for the Backend OJT assessment.

# Structure

## Frontend
This project does not include any frontend interactions.

## Backend
The backend is built with Javascript (Vanilla JS, Express).

Use `npm start` to launch the project and it will be hosted on [http://localhost:3100](http://localhost:3100).


# The Assessment

You have the technical freedom to install any libraries that you deem fit for the tasks.

## Backend

The routes have been premade for you. You have the freedom to use whatever database and ORM technology that you want. You may also opt to eliminate the database entirely and use in-memory storage.

Your task is to implement the actions behind the routes that fulfill the necessary requests.

Student
* GET (all) `/student/`
* GET (single) `/student:/id`
* DELETE `/student/:id`
* PATCH `/student/:id`

User
* GET (all) `/user/`
* GET (single) `/user/:id`
* POST `/register/`
* POST `/login/`

Please refer to this documentation as the basis on how you'll structure your payloads and responses.
